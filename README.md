# _start_here
This will help you gain come context into my repos

The repos herein are the product of my career in the industry. 
Clearly I am unable to post _everything_ because when organisations pay for my work, the output is theirs and not mine.

With that said, like all pros I have built up a few bits and pieces over the years that have been useful to me
 and therefore to the clients that have benefited from my work. And now it's here for you to use as well.

My career has evolved quite a bit. I started out with hobbysist computers from the 1980s: 
 - ZX81, Atari800, BBC-B, Acorn Archimedes A3000 as a scholar
 - Mainframe COBOL/CICS/DB2 in my early career
 - UNIX C/SQL Client/Server in my 20s
 - LAMP in my 30s
 - Java, JEE, Oracle, MySQL and Python in my 40s
 - Python, PHP, PostgreSQL, JS in my 50s
 - Lately been playing with embedded, ML and AI

So there's quite a mix. My go-to technologies tend to be:
 - Linux, bash, C for systems
 - PHP, Apache, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JS for web applications
 - Python, Scipy, Keras, OpenCV2, YOLO for ML and image processing
 - Arduino, STM32, ARM M0 for embedded
 - ARM v8 for SBC

I tend to use frameworks and containers extremely sparingly and I don't go in for unnecessary complexity. 
My philosophy tends to be a "git er done" one. 

You will find quite a bit of overlap as my career and skills have progressed. 

Here are all the projects I can recall over the years with employers/clients noted.

 2014 - Present (Linux 64 bit) 
 SYS9 - PHP framework for web development (People, Places, Things and operations)
 SYS9X - SYS9 bonus packs for testing and domain specific functionilty
